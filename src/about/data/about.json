    "I discovered my passion for software during my sophomore year of college. After a few lectures of EECS 111, I knew that I had found the field to which I wanted to dedicate myself.",
    "I pursued my passion as a software engineer at a big company and at a small one. I learned the intricacies of software development and honed my technical skills. As I grew in my career, my passion for delivering high quality software products grew too. I became laser-focused on attention to detail, mentorship, and cross-functional leadership as ways of ensuring quality and prompt delivery.",
    "Eventually, though, I was drawn to a bigger role in shaping the product from the user’s point of view. My passion for building software products had grown to encompass defining the product itself. While I still love engineering, I have realized that pursuing product management would be the best way to advocate for users and align engineering output with business goals. While I have shifted paths, I won’t leave my engineering experience behind. Instead, with my engineering expertise I hope to bridge the technical and product divide in the software development lifecycle."
