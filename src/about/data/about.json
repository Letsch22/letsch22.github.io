    "I discovered my passion for software during my sophomore year at Northwestern University. After a few lectures of EECS 111, I knew that I had found the field to which I wanted to dedicate myself.",
    "During the remainder of my time in college, I pursued opportunites inside and outside the classroom to learn about coding. Whether it be through a hackathon, a personal project, or a lot of independent reading, I immersed myself in the world of software development.",
    "Since then, I have gained experience in the industry working as a software engineer in many forms. I tackled the challenges of writing firmware and API libraries for Internet of Things devices and services. I met customer requirements when implementing a new feature for a cloud-based product built on Java and an Oracle database. And now, I contribute as an engineer on a scrum team delivering one of the newest and most exciting products our company has to offer.",
